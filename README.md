## How do I apply this? 
1. In Obsidian navigate to: `Settings` > `Appearance` 
2. In the **CSS Snippets** section, select the file icon called, "Open snippets folder"
3. Drag and drop or paste your downloaded `primer-obsidian.css` file into the snippets folder, and close the browser window. 
4. Activate the refresh button that's to the left of the file button. 
5. Toggle the switch for `primer-obsidian`!

## Caveats
- Right now this snippet only works in Obsidian's light mode. 
- The editing mode remains untouched in this version.
- Obsidian snippets only read `css` files, so if you want to use the `.scss` file to make updates you'll have to use a compiler. Any updates published will be compiled to the `.css` file here in this repo.
